            <p>Looking for an entertainment space fit for as many people as you could ever desire? Look no further! Make
                the most out of this space with its retractable tables, which can neatly tuck away to accomodate for any
                crowd size. Connected directly to the kitchen, serving a village worth of people is no issue. Connect to
                the space's surround-sound speakers for another touch of ambiance.</p>
